As a viewer you will need a node.js extension to see the outputs of each challenge! Within your terminal in VScode type "node challlenge1.js" and you will see challenge one's output, "node challlenge2.js" for challenge two, etc. The challenges are broken into two folders for easier accessibility and readability.
